    "description": "Hello! My name is Cory Thomas, a web developer based in Chattanooga, Tennessee.",
    "description2": "Interestingly, my journey into programming started because of the Oculus Rift Development Kit 1 VR headset. I would browse the Oculus forums and noticed several people discussing code which made me want to dive into C++ in 2013. Eventually, I went to college for Computer Science but took a hiatus after two years because I was unsure of what I wanted to specialize in. I remembered my time in high school when I was in the Web Development club and so I started to dabble with it again. Unfortunately, I didn't know that I enjoyed web development back then since I didn't take the club seriously enough. In contrast, I fully committed myself by self-studying for over a year and knew this field was absolutely for me! As a result, I attended Lambda School full time as a full-stack web student and mentor focusing on React, Node, and computer science.",
    "description3": " This journey has been extremely satisfying so far and fulfills my desire to always learn something new and challenging.",
